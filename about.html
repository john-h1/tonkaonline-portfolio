                  <p>Being relatively new to computer science, I am still interested in learning more about it.
                  I started coding with the Scratch tool, and made a few games on there at first.
                  Afterwards, I experimented a bit with JavaScript, and learned a bit of that. I also tried Tynker, but never enjoyed it.
                  At this point, I am learning HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in an online course, because I want to try and broden my experience in coding.
                  I don't have many plans in my future regarding computer science, but I definitely want to keep it at at least a hobby. </p>
