  <h2>About the Website</h2>
  <p>  This website has been created with the purpose of showing the work that I have done as a coder.
   What you are viewing was actually created HTML and CSS, two coding languages that I have learnt a bit of.
   On the CS projects page, you will learn more about the coding I have done already, and what I am learning now.
   In the about page, you will learn a little more about me and how I got interested in coding.
   Thanks for visiting this website, and I hope you learn something. </p>
